-- Nabonid returned from exile to Babylon four years before the fall
-- of Babylon, in 543. This may well have been because his son and 
-- regent Belsazar died, as Belsazar is not mentioned in the Babylonian
-- chronicles afterwards.
-- this is a bit guesswork, though.

-- some scholars think ezra's artaxerxes was the 2nd
-- this might not be true or logical, relevant or interesting; 
-- it does have the merit, however, that if it is true, then he would
-- come as "a messiah" after the first seven weeks of daniel, as some
-- translations have it. after seven weeks "a messiah", after the sixty-two
-- weeks "a messiah" will be cut off. since ezra was high priest according
-- two some sources, it might be possible to call him a "messiah" (anointed
-- one) too.

dNehemia1  |nehemia leaves babylon (445) |-445h 1

-- Nehemiah left for Jerusalem in Nisan rather than the preceding Adar 2. However,
-- we cannot be sure if 445 was counted as a leap year or not, since this not only 
-- depended on various factors which we can not all know (like the weather and the
-- ripeness of barley), but also we cannot be sure that the "correct" decision was
-- made then. If they didn't count it as a leap year, then the below date is correct
-- and 69 "week" later would be Nisan 33 C.E. This seems to be the only reasonable way
-- to reach a date in 30-33 with the passover on a fitting day of week (32 C.E. had
-- it on a Monday which seems to be too much off to be a possible solution).
-- 
-- why would nehemiah leave in 444 rather than 445? if artaxerxes' ascended the throne
-- in summer, then his regnal years would start and end in summer. -465 (summer) - -464 
-- would be his ascension, starting his first year in summer -464 and his 2nd in 
-- summer -445, so spring -444 would still be his 20th year.
